                <p>
                    Just Speak Guitar Lessons is a Voice navigable website I Researched and Developed whilst at
                    University, presented it
                    as part of my Dissertation aad achieved my First Class Degree with it too.
                    Inspired by a UX meeting focusing on the Advancement of Voice technology I discovered that
                    navigating a website
                    or application vocally was an unexplored paradigm for the Web. Loving a challenge, I set my self the
                    task to Measure
                    The Feasibility of Vocally Navigating a Website using a non-AI voice Controlled Algorithm. This case
                    study tells the
                    story on how I answered this using the button below, you can view the complete site.

                <h2>Product Vision</h2>
                <p> The Research and Development vision was to ascertain whether there was any demand from the general
                    public.
                    To answer this a project plan was formed on in preparation to calculate a the Feasibility of Vocally
                    Navigating a Rich Content Website :
                <ul>
                    <li>Focus Group to discover the Users needs from the site.</li>
                    <li>Desk Research on similar sites providing the same service.</li>
                    <li>Rapid Prototyping to produce and test multiple iterations of the designs.</li>
                    <li>Transfer Paper Prototypes to Hi Def Designs and test again.</li>
                    <li>Develop the Website.</li>
                    <li>Test the site on Users.</li>

            <div class="middle">
                <h2>Discoveries</h2>
                <p>
                    User Testing and Focus Groups were formed by recruiting willing participating students from
                    different departments
                    on the University Campus - this was to create an unbiased set of results.
                    <br>
                    The realisation that the Survey would have to go to the general public and not just to students on
                    the University campus
                    occurred.
                    <br>
                    User input was obtained through Public Surveys and Interviews, always ensuring total anonymity for
                    the participants this was to ensure the procedures were ethically upheld.
                    <br>
                    Realisation of the many accents amongst students, creating the keywords that the User's would use
                    would have to be surveyed
                    and the majority of winning keywords would be used during development.
                    <br>
                    Think Aloud Protocol was applied on the completed designs and again on the finished product to
                    capture the user's needs, that the focus group didn't manage to capture.
                    <br>

            </div>
            <div class="end">
                <h2>Outcomes</h2>
                <p> Tasked with designing and developing a Voice Navigable website to answer the Feasibility of such,
                    understanding that every section had to be data-driven in order to answer it without a margin of
                    error. <br>
                    Results from the Focus Groups formed at the beginning, revealed that there was a need for such a
                    Website and especially in this type of domain.
                    The created online Public Surveys proved fruitful with 106 participant's valued input,
                    improved the design's, produced the keywords for development.
                    The results from the Think Aloud Protocol Tests gave excellent input for Design
                    Improvements Development progression.
                    The Quantitative data from the Surveys and Qualitative Data from the User Interviews
                    were triangulated to reveal if the overarching aim was achieved or not.
                    Project planning was calculated an ETA of 4months to complete, suing the Agile Methodology due to
                    the multiple iterations required during each phase.

        <h1>Discovery and Ideation</h1>
        <p>
            Focus group meeting, consisting of 6 participants, with ages ranging from 18 to 58 years of age, each
            studying
            completely different courses at the University.
            This meeting discovered there was certainly a potential for a trend to develop from this type of Website, in
            this type of an educational setting (guitar tutorial).
            There was skepticism involved when the suggestion was made that the project should be a completely stand
            alone,
            voice activated website. It was concluded that it should be a website navigable in the usual way using a
            peripheral
            and voice controlled too.
            It was also revealed that the Tutorial, should act and behave as expected, however, should also be less
            verbose,
            high definition imagery/ videos to be included with a simplistic HCI. <br>
            The data allowed me to paint a clearer picture of what the User's wanted from the product, what they
            expected and more importantly an accurate representation on who wanted the application.
            This information provided me with enough information to build a SWOT Analysis and User personas for
            further research.
        </p>
        <p>
            What followed were efforts to map the existing user experiences to identify other opportunity
            developments:

            <h1>Discovery Analysis</h1>
            <h2>Desk Research</h2>
            <p>A Desk Study study on similar Tutorials available today occurred to identify design patterns and natural
                User Flow.
                so that the new site, although unique to the Web Industry, would be familiar to the user too.
                It was discovered that none of the sites had Voice Control, one had a Guitar Tuner that used the
                microphone. It was
                decided at this point not to include this type od Guitar tuner for this site as it could be catastrophic
                to the
                reason that this site will use the microphone. This became a recommendation for future research and
                development though.
            </p>
            The Javascript libraries found that had some capable Speech Recognition suitable for this website were:
            <ul>
                <li>Artyom.js</li>
                <li>Anyang.js</li>
                <li>Voix.js</li>
                <li>PocketSphinx.js</li>
            </ul>
            <p>After testing the capabilities of these libraries a decision was made to use Annyang.js;
                it was the smallest library available, had no AI technology and was the cut above the rest in
                relation to responsiveness, speed and adaptation in speech recognition in comparison with the others
                identified.

                    <p>Data collected from the User Research and Discovery phase produced User expectations and
                        Future Development Opportunities to include for the website.
                        This data along with expectations for the website design advanced Ideation into
                        Hypothesis and Idea Prioritisation.

                    <p>
                        Based on discovery research findings I came up with three hypothesis to ensure successful
                        Usability, Accessability and Navigation. These covered: <br>
                    <ul>

                        <li>Simple HCI, utilisiation of the unique use of white space to enhance engagement and stop
                            cognitive overload.</li>
                        <li>A visually pleasing and interactive website should increase Customer Retainability.</li>
                        <li>Selective color pallette to increase positive psychology.</li>

                        efficiency values. The highest
                        impact features were expected to be included in the developed product.

                                page hierarchy that was identical for each site. The sites researched had in excess of
                                30+ pages, it was decided that having so many pages for this site was not required for
                                testing reasons.

                Javascript for speech recognition and to enhance the dynamic content.
                It was tested on 15 users (5 for each of the created persona's), in order to to

                User's paralinguistic features were recorded using a web-cam and video recording software at the

                From the previously conducted survey, willing participants tested the prototype created

                <h2>First Pass - Designs and Development.</h2>
                <li>The early prototypes and User Behaviour proved that both Speech Navigation and the Usual method were
                    required to enhance Usability.</li>
                <li>Natural Speech Commands were tested vs Dictated Speech Commands. The keywords found during the
                    Survey were found to be sufficient.
                    Although users could access a table of pre-determined commands at any time no navigate successfully,
                    95% of the keywords were guessed when testing.
                </li>
                <li>Early designs were shown to have too much text content which delayed the user from efficiently
                    moving through to complete tasks, so as requested more imagery and videos were added and verbose
                    removed.</li>
                <li>Color Psychology, Emphasis on in page keywords such as, "Well done" or encouraging quotes
                    increased a positive emotion.</li>
                <li>60% of users found the, in page navigation (index page) on the desktop confusing so redesigning the
                    structure
                    in page
                    navigation (not the top bar) became compulsory.</li>
                <li> A/B testing on the in page navigation section followed, one was the original design and the other
                    was the restructured design.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <h2>Final Pass - Tested Prototype.</h2>
                <p> All Feedback was analysed, errors were caught and designs improved greatly thanks to this.
                    I observed almost entirely positive feedback from the final designs.</p>
                <li>Users found the new in page navigation on the index page much easier to follow.</li>
                <li>Analysis shown that the majority of the users interacted and spent more time using
                    the Speech Navigation as opposed to the usual clickable navigation.</li>
                <li>All participants were able to complete the task of Vocally navigating from the index page, to the
                    last page and back home.
                    The final test of Vocally navigating from the Home Page, to a page and any part of that page they
                    selected, then returning back to the Home page successfully.
                </li>
                <li>During testing it was discovered that 72% of the participants successfully completed the tasks
                    without the
                    need to view the pre-determined command table. Proving the Survey to find natural keywords were a
                    success.
                </li>
                <li>99% of the users were not showing signs of confusion or stress whilst completing the test for the

        <h1>Outcomes</h1>
        <p>
            Based on the findings from both the UX research and the Design/ Development validation sessions I was able
            to produce
            a list of changes that were addressed and updated in the prototype along with any potential future
            alterations should a revisit to develop the keywords to enhance the Voice Navigation further in the
            future.<br>
            Triangulating the Quantitative data from the Surveys and Qualitative Data from the User Interviews during
            and after the Think Aloud Protocol testing, considering that the number of users participating versus users
            successfully completing the tasks
            was in the higher percentile - and at a ratio of 5:4 evaluated that the project was a complete success
            and
            answered the overarching aim of Measuring the Feasibility of Navigating A Rich Content Website Vocally Using
            A Non AI Algorithm.
        </p>

            findings.
