            <p class="section-editorial">
                Just Speak Guitar Lessons is a Voice navigable website I Researched and Developed whilst at University
                and then presented it
                as part of my Dissertation.
                Inspired by a UX meetup on advancement of Voice technology and discovering that navigating a website
                or application vocally was an unexplored paradigm, I set my self the task to Measure The Feasibility of
                Vocally Navigating a Website
                using a non-AI voice Controlled Algorithm.
                The finished product can be viewed here: <br>

            <h1 class="section-title">The problem</h1>

            <p class="section-editorial">
                To Research and develop a website that caters a service to the general public, discover a system that is
                suitable for the project,
                apply UX Research, UCD, User Testing and Front End Development to answer the over arching aim to find
                the Feasibility of
                Navigating A Rich Content Website Vocally.
            </p>

            <p>
                To answer this a focus group was formed on member's of the general public to calculate a general
                consensus of :
            <ul>
                <li>Whether there was a trend in having a voice navigable website.</li>
                <li>The purpose the site would serve (e.g) To combat the need to turn a page whilst multi tasking.</li>
                <li>General keywords a collected group would use to navigate.</li>
                <li>Would this service be a stand alone service or should it be included with the usual method of
                    navigation</li>
            </ul>


            <p> From the focus group many iterations to the wireframes and high-def designs
                following User Testing,
                both on a design and the developed product. Once the project was built and tested, further testing found
                the
                Quantitative and the Qualitative data, this was then Triangulated to answer the over all
                aim.
            </p>
            <span class="emphasis-text">Project planning had an ETA of 4months to completion.</span>


            <p>A complete R and D project to investigate if such a voice command
                system exists, Design and Develop
                the website using UXC principles consisting of :
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Desk Research
                </li>
                <li>
                    Survey What the user expects from the site
                </li>
                <li>Test the prototypes using User Interviews and Testing</li>
                <li>
                    Find issues with the designs, iterate and test again
                </li>
                <li>
                    Build the user friendly site aimed at the given demographic Website using HTML, CSS and JS
                </li>
                <li>
                    Test the Website on the public domain
                </li>
                <li>
                    User friendly site aimed at the given demographic
                </li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <h1 class="section-title">The Task</h1>
            <p>Once the Project management was complete with the individual structured tasks at hand, the project
                started 1/1/2019
                it had a deadline for 18/05/2021. This project was complete 3 weeks before the deadline with the
                over arching
                aim answered with a success, combined with various other projects through out the 3 years, earned
                myself a First
                Class BSc(hons) in Web Design and Web Development.
            </p>

            <h1 class="section-title">Desk Research</h1>
            <p>I studied a few similar applications available to identify patterns.
                so that the new site, although unique to the company, would be familiar to the user too.
                It was identified that none of these sites had a gallery.
            </p>
            <ul class="case-study-list">
                <li>Artyom.js</li>
                <li>Anyang.js</li>
                <li>Voix.js</li>
                <li>PocketSphinx.js</li>
            </ul>
            <p>After testing the capabilities of these libraries a decision was made to use Annyang.js;
                it was the smallest library available, had no AI technology and was the cut above the rest in
                relation to responsiveness and adaptation.
            </p>
            <h1 class="section-title">User Survey and Testing</h1>
            <p>To determine what the user expected from such a project, I conducted a user survey through Google
                Survey
                and a social media platform to get a wide prospective from the public domain and then applied
                that
                data to the designs.
                Below is the mobile version of the final iteration form testing.
            </p>
            <h1 class="section-title">Wire frames</h1>
            <p>
                Once a User Flow and a successful round of testing the User reaction and needs have yielded
                sufficient information,
                I graphically design the High Def Designs using Computer Design Software. My preferred
                choice is
                using Adobe XD although
                I am proficient in using inVision, Zeppelin and most other Design software too. Images and
                Vectors are created in Illustrator
                and Photoshop.

            <h1 class="section-title">User Testing - Round 1</h1>
            <p>Using User Interviews and Think Aloud Protocol, I launched a small test using the above
                Prototype
                to identify what the user's needs were, if there were any flaws and luckily there was only a slight
                flaw in color contrast!

            <h1 class="section-title">User Testing - Round 2</h1>
            <p>Once the website was built a new set of volunteers tested the website.</p>


            <p>Using User Interviews and Think Aloud Protocol, I launched another small test with the exact
                same
                set of tasks, however with a different set of Users. This was to create an un bias set of
                results and
                indeed to see if the concluding iteration was the most successful, improved comprehension,
                encapsulated
                the user emotions whilst keeping the cognitive load low whilst navigating through the site
                and
                completing
                the tasks.
            </p>

                Following a recent review of the website and asking for the publics opinion, the
                site is currently
                going through
                a few design and development alterations. Mainly because it was discovered that some
                mobile
                manufacturers
                dont offer support for some of the CSS syntax used in the original project. In this
                case CSS Grid
                isnt supported on some
                Huawei and Iphone browsers for example.
                If you would like to view the website then please follow this link here: <br>
