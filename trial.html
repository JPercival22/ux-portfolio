                <div class="left-aligned">
                    <p>
                        As part of my journey to become a better UX and UI Designer, learning a new tool becomes a
                        necessary
                        learning curve that one has to
                        endure. Already being proficient in using Adobe's XD and Zeppelin, having some commercial
                        experience
                        using XD both tool's,
                        another tool that other designer's were persuading me to learn was called Figma.
                        Figma on one hand, is similar to the aforementioned tools in the sense that - yes, you can
                        design
                        Wireframes, High Fidelity designs,
                        design Vectors make and share prototypes alike. However, Figma offers a feature that unlocks the
                        boundaries that all of the other tools have and that
                        is responsive design using Auto-Layer!
                        Auto Layer, if you have some development experience is basically Flex for your designs. Adding
                        and
                        removing constraints through Fluid containers
                        for any screen size, all in all making designing more efficient and precise.
                    </p>
                    <p>Please read on through this Case Study on recreating Google Chromes homepage using Figma - Thank
                        You
                        and please enjoy!

                <h2>Product Vision</h2>
                <p> The vision for this case study was to establish a clear understanding on using Figma as a design
                    tool to expand my knowledge in UI and UX Design.
                    Focusing on:
                <ul>
                    <li>Develop my skills in design using Figma's software to enhance Fluid and Responsive design for
                        multiple viewports.</li>
                    <li>Aim to consolidate everything into one single design which will cater for all viewports.</li>
                    <li>To answer this, I had to research development that Figma has made to cater for responsive
                        design.</li>
                    <li>Lastly, collect the data from this research and recreate a responsive design of Google Chrome's
                        Home Page
                        around this data.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col two">
                <h2>Discovered User Problem</h2>
                <p>
                    The issue that designers have whilst using some Design software, is although their end designs are
                    very well engineered
                    and User tested, the software itself - in regards to Fluid Design was found to be either non
                    existent or sub standard.
                    <br>
                    I intended to research a previously unexplored Design Software called Figma, having being influenced
                    by other designers
                    and intrigued from research conducted.
                    <br>
                    The aim was to eliminate 'break point designs' and have one single responsive and interactive design
                    that developers could
                    efficiently utilise on handover. It was discovered that although Figma did provide a tool called,
                    'Auto-Layer,' which
                    encapsulated containers into a more flexible container for a more fluid control over responsiveness,
                    it didn't cater
                    completely and therefore a single page design was not possible at the time of writing (2021).
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col three">
                <h2>Outcomes</h2>
                <p>
                    Tasked with researching and developing new skills in using a new Design Software, naming Figma, to
                    create a single paged
                    interactive Fluid Design rather than having the usual - three non-responsive break point design.
                    Research discovered that Figma does have a feature that can cater for such a task as an integral
                    part of its Software, called, "Auto Layer."
                    As the name suggests it automatically adds a layer to the selected items, which when used correctly,
                    encapsulates them into a fluid child-container.
                    Which, by itself add's constraints and enforced it to behave responsively either in a column or row
                    on user interaction.
                    This does add a further dimension to designing, when this is also added to the parent container, it
                    plays its part and makes
                    the whole design responsive.
                </p>
                It does have a major issue though. At the time of writing (2021), it was discovered that it's not
                completely the answer. As you will you see
                from this case study, the "Auto Layer," feature will only work up to a certain point, whereby the
                content inside is no longer responding effectively
                and a new breakpoint is required.
                Concluding that although having just one single interactive and responsive design was not possible yet.
                That being said it will make for more
                efficient designing and development having only needing two breakpoint designs which are also responsive
                and interactive.

                <h1>Discovery and Ideation</h1>
                <div class="left-aligned">
                    <p>
                        I began by researching the existing market on Design Software that included fluid design when
                        the user
                        interacted. After some investigation
                        and analysis of 5 of the most popular Design Software available on the market to date (2021),
                        surprisingly
                        only one product catered for fluid interactive
                        design.
                        What was more surprising was that this type of feature more than likely in the a marketing
                        sense, would be a
                        "paid for," feature, certainly Adobe
                        although they do have a time limited version of their Design Software available on the market,
                        wouldn't shy
                        away from charging for this type of
                        feature for their product. Figma's free version comes with this for all available versions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What followed were efforts to discover which software offered more design tools, which had the
                        best user
                        reviews and more importantly which
                        software offered support to eliminate the break point design system that would enable to have
                        one responsive
                        and interactive design as the end goal,
                        or as a maximum requirement, would have the less if break points as possible:

                        After some research and contemplation, it was decided that Google Chromes Homepage was the most
                        simplistic and most familiar to users.
                        This was because the majority of Internet users trended towards the browser and has done for the
                        majority of time too. Overall that trend,
                        at time of writing (2021), stood at 65.27% of the global share of the market! That is for
                        example, more
                        than 6 in 10 people use this browser
                        over any other - a sure sign that its overall simplicity, familiarity, accessability and
                        usability
                        surpass every other browser available today.

            <p>
                The prototype has been tested on 15 users (5 for each of the created persona's), in order to to
                validate my
                Hypothesis. Using the previously determined User Flow to guide the User through the prototype.
                User's paralinguistic features were recorded using a web-cam and video recording software at the
                agreement of the participant, they were tested ethically a new set of participants were brought
                in for the second wave of testing. The identity of the participants shall remain anonymised as agreed.
            </p>
            <p>
                From the previously conducted survey, willing participants tested the prototype created
                for mobile and desktop viewport's using the Think Aloud Protocol. Asking a series of open ended
                questions
                the test administrator
                was able to understand how the user's felt about the product whilst also testing the age ranges
                specified
                earlier to expand the customer base.
            <ul>
                <h2>Earlier Tested Designs.</h2>
                <li>The early prototypes proved that the pre-determined User flow was correct.</li>
                <li>Primary and Secondary buttons were required for some of the features, such as the
                    video sections for example. First wave of testing proved that having one button for all was
                    confusing.</li>
                <li>Early designs were shown to have too much text content which delayed the user from efficiently
                    moving through to complete tasks.</li>
                <li>The initial checkout design proved my hypothesis to be correct by adding different payment methods
                    for the user.</li>
                <li>Color Psychology, Emphasis on SEO keywords such as, "Risk Free" and offering Credit Card Security
                    increased efficiency and a positive emotion.</li>
                <li>The majority of User's found a scrollable review section cumbersome and preferred a more modern
                    "swipeable" section instead. Designing the new carousel became priority.</li>
                <li> A/B testing on the review section followed, one was scrollable and the other was
                    swipeable.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <h2>Final Tested Designs.</h2>
                <p> All Feedback was analysed, errors were caught and designs improved greatly thanks to this.
                    I observed almost entirely positive feedback from the final designs.</p>
                <li> User's found the new
                    buttons easier to use and determined the importance of each swiftly.</li>
                <li>Analysis shown that the majority of the users interacted and spent more time using
                    the swipeable version of the review section.</li>
                <li>All participants were able to complete the checkout section with ease and return back
                    to the home screen.</li>
                <li>99% of the users were not showing signs of confusion or stress whilst completing the test for the
                    final version.</li>

        <h1>Outcomes</h1>
        <p>
            Based on the findings from both the UX research and the Design validation sessions I was able to produce
            a list of changes that were addressed and updated in the prototype along with any potential future
            alterations for the Application passed onto the company.<br>
            It was realised during the Validation stage that all of the user's became concerned when they clicked on
            the video section of the design and wondered why the video didn't play. It was mentioned prior to
            testing that there was no promotional video provided as the
            company wanted their application to appeal to the general public and at that moment in time was
            developed as businesses tool.
            They did
            not want to confuse the participants by advertising something that it wasn't going to be, so a decision
            on their part was to not include the video. Another thing was because of the potential improvements
            found was
            significantly different to the application that they had, some of the details in the designs such as
            descriptive text will
            change once those improvements are developed.
