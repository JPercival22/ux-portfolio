                <h1>Recreating Chrome's Home Page Using Figma.</h1>
                <div class="left-aligned">
                    <p>
                        As part of my journey to become a better UX and UI Designer, learning new design tools becomes a
                        necessary
                        learning curve that one has to
                        endure. Already being proficient in using Adobe's XD and Zeppelin and gaining some commercial
                        experience
                        using both sets of software too,
                        there was another piece of software that other designer's were persuading me to learn called
                        Figma.
                        Figma on one hand, is similar to the aforementioned in the sense that - yes, you can
                        design
                        Wireframes, High Fidelity designs,
                        design Vectors and make and share prototypes alike. However, Figma offers a feature that unlocks
                        the
                        boundaries that all of the other's cant escape from yet and that
                        is responsive design using their new feature named Auto-Layer!
                    </p>
                    <p>Please read on through this Case Study on recreating Google Chromes homepage using Figma - Thank
                        You
                        and please enjoy!

                <h2>Product Vision</h2>
                <p> The vision for this case study was to establish a clear understanding on using Figma as a design
                    tool to expand my knowledge in UI and UX Design.
                    Focusing on:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Upgrading skills in UX & UI design using Figma's software to enhance break point design
                        with responsiveness</li>
                    <li>An over arching aim to,"Investigate whether or not a design can be responsive in as
                        less break points as possible." </li>
                    <li>To answer this, I had to research development that Figma has made to cater for responsive
                        design.</li>
                    <li>Lastly, collect the data from this research and recreate a data driven responsive design of
                        Google
                        Chrome's
                        Home Page.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="col two">
                <h2>Discovered User Problem</h2>
                <p>
                    The issue that designers have whilst using Design software, is although their designs are
                    very well structured, the software itself - in regards to Responsive Design is found to be either
                    non
                    existent or sub standard.
                    <br>
                    I intended to research a previously unexplored Design Software called Figma, having being influenced
                    by other designers
                    and intrigued from research conducted.
                    <br>
                    The aim was to add responsiveness to the usual break point design, so
                    that developers could
                    efficiently utilise on handover. It was discovered that although Figma did provide a tool called,
                    'Auto-Layer,' which
                    encapsulated containers into a more flexible container for a more fluid control over responsiveness,
                    it didn't cater
                    completely and therefore a single page design was not possible at the time of writing (2021), rather
                    the
                    same breakpoint design as before but with responsiveness.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col three">
                <h2>Outcomes</h2>
                <p>
                    Tasked with researching and developing new skills in using a new Design Software, naming Figma, to
                    create an
                    interactive responsive break point design.
                    Research discovered that Figma does have a feature that can cater for such a task as an integral
                    part of their Software, they named, "Auto Layer."
                    As the name suggests it automatically adds a layer to the selected items, which when used correctly,
                    encapsulates them into a fluid child-container.
                    Which, by itself add's constraints and enforces it to behave responsively either in a column or row
                    on user interaction. This revolutionises design, allows the designer to work efficiently and
                    concentrate more on the things that matter and allows the developer more insight into what the
                    designer wants.
                    This does add a further dimension to designing, when this is also added to the parent container,
                    this cohesively make the responsive design possible.
                </p>
                It does have a major issue though. At the time of writing (2021), it was discovered that it's not
                completely the answer. As you will you see
                from this case study, the "Auto Layer," feature will only work up to a certain point, whereby the
                content inside is no longer responding effectively
                and a new breakpoint is required.
                Concluding that although having just one single interactive and responsive design was not possible yet.
                That being said it will make for more
                efficient designing and development having only needing two breakpoint designs which are also responsive
                and interactive.

                        I began by researching the existing market on Design Software that included responsive design.
                        After some investigation
                        and analysis on 5 of the most popular Design Software available on the market to date (2021),
                        surprisingly -
                        only one product catered for responsive interactive
                        design.
                        More surprising was that this type of feature, first thought of in the a marketing
                        sense, would have been part of the subscription feature, Figma's provided this as part of their
                        free version.

                        After conducting some research and contemplation, it was decided that Google Chromes Homepage
                        was the most
                        simplistic and most familiar to users.
                        This was because the majority of Internet users trended towards the browser and has done for the
                        majority of time too. Overall that trend,
                        at time of writing (2021), stood at 65.27% of the global share of the market!
                        (Gs.statcounter.com 2021) To put that into context, more
                        than 6 in 10 people use this browser
                        over any other - a sure sign that its overall simplicity, familiarity, accessability and
                        usability
                        surpasses every other browser available today.

                        or paid online version or a downloadable
                        version, all versions come with the, "Auto Layer," feature included.
                        Research found that it is this same feature that should cater for the interactive, dynamic and

                    <p> On first thought, one must feel a little uncertain as far as
                        responsive web design
                        is concerned and past technology fails. As viewports resize,
                        elements within the design resize and move around the grid too, from a row structure to a column
                        based structure -
                        here is where ones skepticism may increase, as this shift occurs in design more breakpoints are
                        required. The
                        need for an unbiased and full investigation on this new technology that could
                        indeed change the way we design for the future, could indeed answer the over arching aim or not.

                        now Frames can also react to objects within them through Auto Layout. For example, if one wanted
                        to add
                        content to a
                        button. Before this technology was available, a designer would have to add width, padding and
                        margins to their designs.
                        Following the research, it was found that a designer can now effortlessly add an Auto layer to
                        the button, which
                        increases/decreases the constraints inside
                        and
                        outside of that element, depending on the work carried out - thus saving time and making the
                        dynamic work.

                        Further research found that in order to make Auto Layer work, a group of elements must be
                        selected, then Auto Layer can be selected, either by right clicking the option to do so or by
                        selecting it in the options in Figma's GUI. Doing so, creates a Frame, this frame then
                        became the <i>parent</i> container,
                        naturally those inside would then become the <i>children</i> elements. Which would have been in
                        the
                        button above case - the button container and the text respectfully.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On application, it was quickly discovered that once Auto Layout was applied, many properties
                        were converted. Padding, the spacing between children, the axis for lining up children, and the
                        order of children are all guessed based on an average. If you apply to a group or a selection it
                        becomes a frame. Any background layer disappears as frames can now have fill colors. Finally,
                        text boxes that had a fixed size convert to auto, as Figma believe that’s what most
                        people expect in an Auto Layout.

                    <p>If you have Web Development experience, like myself, you may find that this is giving the
                        designer
                        the power to add a CSS Layout Module called Flexbox to their designs. Those that don't have Web
                        Development
                        experience, basically a Flexbox Layout module gives components on a web page a responsive
                        structure enabling
                        whole pages to have responsiveness as screen sizes decrease and increase, which in turn improves
                        the
                        structural integrity of a website/ application to be displayed on any device.

                    <p>In order to replicate the re-design of the selected Google Home page, wireframes were
                        produced, of which recorded the dimensions
                        of the actual <span><a href="https://www.google.com">Google Home page</a></span> at three main
                        break points. Large Desktop (1800px), Tablet (780px) and Mobile
                        Device (400px). The aim here was to record
                        margins, padding and position of all the elements as the page was resized. This was to
                        demonstrate, once the redesign was complete, whether
                        using this technique would (a) resize and position elements within a reasonably accurate amount
                        (within 10px) from the original specifications recorded and thus (b) answer the overarching aim
                        of accurately make a responsive and interactive and responsive break point design.

                    After studying the Home page closely, examining each component's constraints (margin, padding,
                    height and width) for any alterations and the only major difference when resizing, apart from
                    obviously the width and height constraints
                    of the viewport, was the empty container size (see wireframes above). Everything else remained
                    consistent throughout. That being said, this change from lengthy vertical shift to a short
                    horizontal space, could prove too difficult for this new feature.
                    Of course at this point, this was just a presumption and nevertheless the test continued.
                </p>
                <p>Another detail was discovered through the research, Auto Later can only be applied to objects that
                    have an equal amount of distance between one and other. It may look as though all of the navigation
                    and search elements are equidistance
                    but they are not when scrutinised on closer inspection. That being said, a work around could be
                    possible.
